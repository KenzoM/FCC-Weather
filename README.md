## Getting Started

[Live Demo](http://kenzomendoza.com/FCC-Weather/app/)

>User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.

>User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

>User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

This app was made possible by [Open Weather's API](https://openweathermap.org/current#geo)
